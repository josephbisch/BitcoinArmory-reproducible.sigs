Armory reproducible build signatures

There are two main directories: deb-package.sigs holds the signatures for the
deb packages for Debian-based distros and gitian.sigs holds everything else.

The deb-package.sigs uses the buildinfo file generated by the Debian
reproducible build tools. You sign the buildinfo file with a command like the
following:

gpg --detach-sign file.buildinfo

You verify the buildinfo file with a command like the following:

gpg --verify file.buildinfo.sig

The gitian.sigs uses the Gitian tools and assert files. Refer to Gitian
documentation for information on signing and verifying Gitian signatures.
